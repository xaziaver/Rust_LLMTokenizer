 later
 shifted
 her
 focus
 toward
 country
 music
,
 inspired
 by
 Shania
 Twain

 songs

everyone
 in

 town
 wanted

 do
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do

,
 I
 kept
 thinking
 to
 myself

,

 deal
 and
 began
 making
 frequent
 trips
 to
 Nashville
 with

,
 Brett

,
 Mac
 McAnally

 began
 meeting
 for
 two
-hour
 writing
 sessions
 every
 Tuesday
 afternoon
 after
 school
.[
41
]
 Rose
 called
 the
 sessions
 "
some
 of
 the
 easiest
 I
've
 ever
 done
.
 Basically
,
 I
 was
 just
 her
 editor
.
 She
'd
 write
 about
 what
 happened
 in
 school
 that
 day
.
 She
 had
 such
 a
 clear
 vision
 of
 what
 she
 was
 trying
 to
 say
.
 And
 she
'd
 come
 in
 with
 the
 most
 incredible
 hooks

 but
 left
 then
 BMG
-owned
 RCA
 Records
 (
later
 bought
 by
 Sony
 Music
)
 at
 the
 age
 of
 
14
 due
 to
 the
 label
's
 lack
 of
 care
 and
 them
 "
cut
[ting
]
 other
 people
's
 stuff
".
 She
 was
 also
 concerned
 that
 development
 deals
 can
 shelve
 artists
[
33
][
23
]
 and
 recalled
:
 "
I
 genuinely
 felt
 that
 I
 was
 running
 out
 of
 time
.
 I
 wanted
 to
 capture
 these
 years
 of
 my
 life
 on
 an
 album
 while
 they
 still
 represented
 what
 I
 was
 going
 through
."[
